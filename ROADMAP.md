### üîú Upcoming Goals (Short-Term)

-   **Add a "Last Updated" column:** We plan to add a column to each tool in the `Dataset.csv` and `README.md` to indicate when its information was last verified.
-   **Expand "Tool Showdowns":** Create more head-to-head comparison pages for other popular categories (e.g., "AI Music Generators," "AI Research Assistants").
-   **Create a "New Tools Spotlight" section:** Add a section to the main `README.md` to highlight the latest exciting tools added to the directory.

### üöÄ Future Vision (Long-Term)

-   **Interactive Search Interface:** Develop a simple web interface (e.g., using Streamlit or GitHub Pages) that allows users to search, filter, and sort the entire dataset dynamically.
-   **Community-Sourced Ratings:** Explore a system to allow users to rate and review tools, adding another layer of valuable data.
-   **Localization:** Translate the `README.md` and core documentation into other languages to increase global reach.

We welcome contributions and ideas! If you'd like to help with any of these goals, please open an issue to discuss it.
